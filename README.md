This project was created for the [Admin Dashboard assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/admin-dashboard) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it by adding my own colour scheme.

The goal of this project was to gain experience with website layouts using CSS Grid.

The page contains a responsive grid of 'Project cards' nested inside a static dashboard layout, simulating the interface for an administrator of a social media website.

*** Note: Mobile layouts were not a priority for this project. The main focus was the CSS Grid workflow. ***
