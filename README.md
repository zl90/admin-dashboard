# admin-dashboard
A sample admin dashboard built with CSS Grid.

I built this project to gain experience with website layouts using CSS Grid.

The page contains a responsive grid of 'Project cards' nested inside a static dashboard layout, simulating the interface for an administrator of a social media website.

****Note: The page is not currently mobile friendly. Mobile responsiveness was not a priority of this project.****

The live page can be accessed here: https://zl90.github.io/admin-dashboard/
